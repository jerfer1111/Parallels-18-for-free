# Parallels-18-for-free
Are you looking for a way to use Parallels Desktop for free on a Mac? If so, you have come to the right place.

For programmers who want to test code on both Mac and PC, or gamers who appreciate Mac speed but can’t give up PC game options, having a Mac with Windows is the ideal choice.

However, the challenge lies in the cost associated with achieving this. Parallels, the application that facilitates this capability, is also quite expensive. Personally, I’ve also desired to test code on a Windows OS using my Mac.

## What is Parallels?
Parallels Desktop for Mac is virtualization software that lets you seamlessly run Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Google Chrome OS on your Apple Mac. It integrates guest operating systems into macOS, allowing you to use Windows apps alongside Mac apps. The software offers different modes, including coherence mode for simultaneous app usage, full-screen mode for a complete guest desktop, and modality for customizable virtual machine windows. IT administrators can manage Windows VMs efficiently using the Business Edition

## Pros & Cons whilst using Parallels

| Pros  | Cons |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
| Windows (or other OS) virtualization on machines running MacOS  | I think it slows down over time, but this is linked to Windows bloating.  |
| Using Windows apps side by side with your Mac apps  | I think Coherence Mode could improve slightly…how the windows search window populates and moves around sometimes are weird.   |
| Coherence Mode allows you to hide the Windows Virtual Machine and only interact with the Windows Apps (no Windows desktop in the browser window)  | Memory Usage optimization  |

## Bother Using Parallels?
Indeed, there are tasks that can only be accomplished on a Windows machine. However, leveraging the smooth performance of Mac computers is hard to resist. Using Parallels for Windows-specific tasks is a good practice, while macOS excels in overall smoothness and user experience. The Apple ecosystem is truly commendable though.
